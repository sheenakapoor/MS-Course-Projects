# MS-Course-Projects

This repo contains all the projects done during my Masters at Carnegie Mellon University in various courses.
## Data Modeling and Visualization
Performed EDA and implemented Random Forest model to analyze bank data for how factors like sector-wise Credit and ESG features affect the performance of the company based on the probability of default.
Improved the original Decision Tree classification model scores by 14% with hyperparameter tuning of the Random Forest model with methods like cross-validation, k-fold, AUC/ROC curves, etc. 
Visualized data to draw correlations of multiple factors and compared models for efficiency.

## Mathematical Modeling of Chemical Engineering Processes
Developed theoretical models to study the dynamics of a greenhouse gas, NO2, and modeled the emissions and concentrations in Python. 
Produced future predictions for the model developed with four cases of possible developments of increase in NO2 levels: continuing the same trend as before, not changing after 2018, stopping at 2050, and stopping at 2100.

## Process Systems Modeling
Modeled and simulated an ODE system for a Non-Isothermal CSTR (Hick’s Reactor) in Python. 
Implemented Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network model using PyTorch to represent the nonlinear ODE system as a predictive model and compared accuracy with a model created using the numerical RK4 method. Obtained RMSE of 0.0073, indicating extremely high accuracy.

## Creating Scientific Research Software
Project imported from Class repo, here's the link: https://github.com/sheenakapoor/Weather-Forecasting-Package

Built a licensed package that accesses data from a REST API and forecasts weather in an area based on the user’s zip code and performs various operations like unit conversions etc. 
Created a pip installable and reusable package with command-line utilities, and managed it in a GitHub repo. 
Formatted the python scripts with black, pylint, and flake8. Ensured smooth automation of the software workflow with GitHub actions tests.
